# Amazon_clone
This project is a front-end clone of the Amazon website built using HTML and CSS. It replicates the core layout and design of Amazonâ€™s homepage, including the navigation bar with search and cart functionality. The project focuses on practicing responsive web design, clean UI development, and the use of CSS flexbox for layout.
